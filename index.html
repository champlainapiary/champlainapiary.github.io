<h1>Welcome to the <b>Apiary</b>.</h1>
The Champlain Apiary was established in the Spring of 2013 to provide experiential learning opportunities for our students and community members and to support the college's commitment to sustainability.  This living laboratory gives us a window into the fascinating lives of a uniquely social organism that teaches us about the intricacies of group decision-making, communication, and community.  At a time when feral and managed bee populations are in decline, our bees benefit Champlain's campus and the surrounding landscape through the pollination services they provide.  The honey produced by our bees is bottled and marketed by our students, and all proceeds benefit the educational mission and material support of the apiary.  Thank you to the many faculty, staff, students, and community members who have made this endeavor possible.

<!--- HONEY BEE BASICS --->
<div id="basicsmark" class="navjump"></div>
<div id="basics" class="section"><div class="marker"><img src="img/Marker_Basics.png"></img></div>
<div class="section_header">Honey Bee <b>Basics</b></class></div>
<div class="content">Our campus keeps the species <i>Apis mellifera</i>, the Western honey bee, which live and work together in our hives.  Existing perennially, or throughout the winter, this system of semi-dormancy is unique to this bee species.  The bees form a cluster around the queen in the center of the hive and maintain a temperature of 85&degF by consuming honey and vibrating their wing muscles.  There is a constant exchange of position by the bees from outside to inside and back again to keep them warm.  Almost the entire workforce of the hive is female (the worker bees); the male drones are limited to several hundred and do no work in their own colony.  Their only job is to leave the colony and mate with virgin queens from other colonies.   
<br /><input type="checkbox" id="basicsmore" name="More"><label for="basicsmore">Read</label></input>
<div class="hidden"><br />Drones are bigger than worker bees and develop in larger cells.  When the queen lays an egg in one of these larger cells, she "knows" the egg must be unfertilized.  All worker eggs are fertilized.  As worker bees mature, epigenetic controls (proteins that turn genes on and off) advance her through her delegated tasks of nurse, builder, guard, and forager bee.  This epigenetic control actually changes the form, function, and behavior of the bee.  For instance, as the bee matures from nurse to builder the hypopharyngeal gland, originally used to produce royal jelly, transitions to process wax in order to build comb.  Next, workers move to the entrance of the hive to guard it. Finally, in their last two weeks of life, the worker bees leave the hive to forage for nectar, pollen, water, and propolis. 
<br /><br />
Worker bees, unlike drones, have stingers.  In contrast to the queen's smooth dual sting and ovipositor, these workers have a barbed sting attached to a venom sac.  This also contains alarm pheromones that help other bees find what they're attacking.    If the worker sting pierces the thick skin of mammals (like us humans), the barb prevents the sting from coming out, which invariably causes the bee to die.  
<br /><br />
Reproductive responsibility lies on the queen bee, whose abdomen is shiny and elongated to hold her many eggs.  Attendants feed her a rich diet of royal jelly, the protein-rich, pollen-based food she needs in order to lay eggs.  By lowering her back end into empty honeycomb cells, she lays up to 1,500 eggs a day.  Eggs are fed royal jelly for the first three days and are then weaned to honey and pollen for the next seven.   Ten days after hatching, the new bee will spin a cocoon in which it will metamorphose into an adult bee.
<br /><br />
Propagating new queens is a special process and typically begins when workers build special elongated cells to hang from beneath the comb.  Filled with normal fertilized eggs, these queen cells are fed royal jelly throughout their pupation.  Once the first queen emerges, she'll make a sound to which other hatched or unhatched queens will respond.  Using this special tracking maneuver, she finds and kills her regal competition.  If more than one queen survives, the hive will swarm, a reproductive process by which the old queen and her followers find a new location to start building a new hive.  When the new virgin queen is mature enough to mate, she leaves the hive to mate with drones of other colonies.  The virgin queen will mate with 12-20 drones to fill her spermatheca (semen bladder), so that she can commence laying eggs and building the colony for the rest of her life.

<!--- HONEY --->
<div id="honeymark" class="navjump"></div>
<div id="honey" class="section grey"><div class="marker"><img src="img/Marker_Honey.png"></img></div>
<div class="section_header"><b>Honey</b></class></div>
<div class="content">Champlain honey is raw/unfiltered and is not heated/pasteurized in any way.  As such, it may crystallize due to the bits of pollen, wax, and propolis that have been left in it, or as a result of the floral source.  The crystallization process does not compromise the flavor - it only changes the texture.  If you like a little "chew" to your honey, enjoy it as is.  If you don't, just bathe the jar in hot water (less than 130&degF) like the label says to re-dissolve the crystals.  Just don't put it in the microwave - it zaps all the good enzymes. 
<br /><br />
Champlain honey is bottled and labeled by students and is available for purchase in a variety of sizes at The Lodge in IDX while supplies last.  All proceeds go back to the bees.

<h2>Resources of the Hive</h2>
Collected from a wide variety of flowers, nectar is a bee's main source of carbohydrates and is the diluted, sweet solution from which the honey is made.  Foraging bees bring nectar back to the hive, where a receiver bee will communicate her intention to take the forager's load by beating her antennae against the forager's body and probing the forager's mouth with her tongue.  Transferring the nectar from the stomach lets workers add invertase and oxidase, enzymes that inhibit the growth of mold and bacteria and impart the antibiotic power of hydrogen peroxide to the ripening honey; this gives honey its indefinite shelf-life.  Receivers then search for clean, empty combs in which to expel the nectar for storage. Next, other bees evaporate the additional water in the nectar by fanning it with their wings until the water content is reduced to approximately 18% and the sweetness and flavor are concentrated into ripened honey.  Lastly, workers seal each cell with wax for freshness.  Cases of sealed honey have been found perfectly preserved in Egyptian tombs!

<br /><br />In addition to nectar, pollen is collected as a protein source for the hive and is especially important for raising brood.  Foragers collect pollen from a variety of plants and load it into the basket-like pouches on their hind limbs. Once back in the hive, the pollen is combined with honey, enzymes, and phytocides to prevent spoiling and germination, and thus creating the "bee bread" that bees consume as a protein source. 
<br /><br />
Bees are also able to produce a substance called royal jelly through their hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands; these glands mature shortly after hatching, so worker bees can feed the queen and brood.  Royal jelly is rich in protein and B vitamins and turns regular worker larvae into queens, if it is fed to them continuously.  It was popular in China as a tonic for vitality and fertility and has recently made its way into health food stores in the U.S.
<br /><br />
<h2>The Potential Healing Properties of Honey</h2>
Honey has been used as a healing aid.  Ancient writings from Sumer, Egypt, China, Greece, and Rome can be found touting its medicinal importance.  Because honey is hygroscopic (draws water) and acidic, it dehydrates and kills any microorganisms within it.  Its viscosity and low concentration of hydrogen peroxide made it a standard for dressing wounds as recently as the 1940's, and unlike many antibiotic creams that slow or stop the growth of healing cells, honey nourishes new cell growth.  In a study that compared its healing properties with synthetic treatments, honey fully healed 87% of burn victims within fifteen days in comparison to only 10% of patients being fully healed in the same time frame with topical antibiotics.  In addition, because some kids cannot easily digest the active ingredients in cold medicine, in 2007 the FDA recommended a ban on cold medicines for children under six.  A study conducted at Penn State suggested that buckwheat honey, with the highest antioxidant content of any honey, is a smart choice against colds.

<!--- BEES IN DECLINE --->
<div id="declinemark" class="navjump"></div>
<div id="decline" class="section white" class="white"><div class="marker"><img src="img/Marker_Decline.png"></img></div>
<div class="section_header">Bees in <b>Decline</b></class></div>
<div class="content">Humans and honey bees have a rich history, and the Western honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) has become an important player in food production.  With pollination services valued at $25 billion in North America alone, honey bees are one of the most important determinants of overall yield for many crops of tree nuts, berries, fruits, and vegetables.  They also produce other valuable products, including honey, beeswax, pollen, royal jelly, and propolis and are responsible for the pollination and propagation of many native plants in Vermont, thereby contributing to the ecological diversity and attractiveness of the landscape.  
<br /><br />
Considering the economic and ecological importance of the honey bee, the decline of this organism is unfortunate and alarming.  Honey bees have recently fallen victim to a syndrome known as colony-collapse disorder (CCD), which is thought to be caused by the synergistic effects of pesticides, pathogens, habitat-loss, and an overall loss of genetic diversity.  In a 2010 synthesis report, the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) recognized a "significant and constant decline in domestic honey bee colony numbers" in North America and Europe, and CCD has brought global awareness to the current plight of both domestic and wild bee populations.  This is an opportune time to establish an apiary at Champlain, however small in scale, to educate the community and contribute to the preservation of this invaluable and fascinating organism.
